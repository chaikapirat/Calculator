# Programmer Calculator

This is a **Programmer Calculator** built using **Java Swing**. It supports various numeral systems such as **Hexadecimal**, **Decimal**, and **Binary**, and includes a wide range of mathematical and logical operations. This calculator is designed for programmers and engineers who need to perform quick calculations in different numeric systems.

The project was created as part of my personal learning journey to improve Java skills, especially focusing on GUI development and handling different number systems.

## Features
- **Supports multiple numeral systems**:
  - **Hexadecimal (HEX)**
  - **Decimal (DEC)**
  - **Binary (BIN)**
- **Basic arithmetic operations**:
  - Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`)
- **Bitwise operations**:
  - **AND**, **OR**, **XOR**
- **Bit shifting operations**:
  - **Left shift (<<)**, **Right shift (>>)**
- **Logical NOT operation** (`NOT`)
- **User-friendly GUI** designed using Java Swing
- **Real-time display** that adapts based on selected numeral system
- **Clear functionality** to reset the calculator and start fresh

## How to Use
1. **Run the application**:
   - Ensure you have **Java 8** or higher installed on your system.
   - Compile the Java code:
     ```bash
     javac calculator.java
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     java calculator
     ```
2. **Select a numeral system** (Hexadecimal, Decimal, or Binary) using the radio buttons at the top.
3. **Input numbers** using the on-screen buttons corresponding to the selected numeral system (hexadecimal, decimal, or binary digits).
4. **Choose operations** (e.g., addition, subtraction, bitwise operations) using the provided buttons.
5. **View results** on the display area. The results are shown in the selected numeral system.
6. **Clear the screen** using the "Clear" button.

## Requirements
- **Java 8 or higher**
- **Swing** 
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
  
## Acknowledgements
- Java Swing for creating the graphical user interface.
- Bitwise operations for supporting logical and bit manipulation operations.

## Example
1. Select **Hexadecimal** mode.
2. Input `A` (which is `10` in decimal).
3. Select the **AND** operation, and input `B` (which is `11` in decimal).
4. Click the **Equal** button (`=`) to get the result of `A AND B` (which is `A`).
